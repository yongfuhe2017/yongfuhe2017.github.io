## 2. Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy


This module focuses on *the first step in the negotiation process—planning for a negotiation*. After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Decide if a negotiation is position-based or interest-based
- Decide if a negotiation is dispute-resolution or deal-making
- Complete a negotiation analysis, including: setting a reservation price and stretch goal, identifying alternatives to a deal, and finding the zone of potential agreement
- Use a decision tree to determine your BATNA
- Conduct cross-cultural negotiations
- Resolve ethical issues in negotiations
- Decide if you should use an agent in a negotiation

### 2.1 Assessing Your Negotiating Style

To assess your negotiation style while preparing for negotiations, complete the following three steps:

>>
- Complete the attachment to assess and understand your negotiating style.
- Use the assessment to assess the style of the other side. This is especially important in cross-cultural negotiations. Remember that there can be considerable variation in negotiation style within a culture.
- Do a gap analysis. Locate the major gaps between your style and the style of the other side. Focus on these gaps when preparing for the negotiation.

Additional tip: After completing the gap analysis, try a role reversal exercise where you use the style of the other side. This will enable you to better understand the other side’s style.

- `Assessing Your Negotiating Style`

Instructions: Listed below are ten important traits of a person’s negotiating style and approach. Each trait demonstrates a wide range of variations, which can be organized along a continuum, as has been done below. With respect to each trait, indicate with an X where your own negotiating style and approach in business negotiation falls along each continuum.

- Goal: What is your goal in business negotiations: a binding contract or the creation of a relationship?

- Attitudes: What is your attitude toward negotiation: win/lose or win/win?

- Personal Styles: During negotiations, is your personal style informal or formal?

![](http://litaotao.github.io/images/personal%20styles.png)

- Communications: Is your communication style in negotiation direct (for instance, clear and definite proposals and answers) or indirect (for instance, vague, evasive answers)?

![](http://litaotao.github.io/images/communications.png)

- Time Sensitivity: In the negotiation process, is your sensitivity to time high (for instance, you want to make a deal quickly) or low (you negotiate slowly)?

![](http://litaotao.github.io/images/high%3Alow.png)

- Emotionalism: During negotiations, is your emotionalism high (that is, you have a tendency to display your emotions) or low (you hide your feelings)?

![](http://litaotao.github.io/images/high%3Alow.png)

- Agreement Form: Do you prefer agreements that are specific (that is, detailed) or general?

- Agreement Building: Do you view negotiation as bottom up (reach agreement on details first) or top down (begin with agreement on general principle)?

![](http://litaotao.github.io/images/agreement%20building.png)

- Team Organization: As a member of a negotiating team, do you prefer having one leader who has authority to make a decision or decision making by consensus?

![](http://litaotao.github.io/images/team%20organization.png)

- Risk Taking: Is your tendency to take risks during negotiations high (for instance, your opening offer to sell is extremely high) or low?

### 2.2 Checklist of Ethical Standards and Guidelines

- *Required by Law*:

    - No Fraud. (Do not lie.)
    - Uphold your fiduciary duty. (If there is a fiduciary relationship with the other side, you owe the highest duty of trust and loyalty.)
    - Don’t act in an unconscionable manner. (When you are in a dominant position of power, try to reach an agreement that is fair to the other side.)
    
- *Voluntary Ethical Standards and Guidelines*:

    - Organizational standards. (If your employer has a Code of Conduct, does it provide standards for your negotiations?)
    - Someone you admire. (What would someone you admire do in your situation?)
    - Family test. (How would you feel when describing to your family what you did during a negotiation?)
    - Newspaper test. (How would you feel if a newspaper article in the local paper described what you did during a negotiation?)
    - Golden Rule. (Treat others as you want to be treated. Keep in mind that fairness is very important to the other side.)
